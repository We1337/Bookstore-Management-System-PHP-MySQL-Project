                <h4>Our Story</h4>
                <p class="text-justify container">
                    Founded in 2023, Bookstore has been a pillar of the literary community for over 1 years. It all began when We1337, a lifelong lover of books, decided to turn their passion into a profession. With a small collection of books and a big dream, We1337 opened the doors of our beloved bookstore.
                    <br>
                    Since then, we have grown into a thriving hub for book enthusiasts, offering a vast selection of genres and a cozy atmosphere that encourages exploration and discovery.
